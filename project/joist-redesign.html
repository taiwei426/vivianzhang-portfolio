					<h2 class="section_title">Joist Redesign</h2>
					<p>Joist helps trade contractors (ie: anyone who works on your home, like roofers, landscapers) with <b>estimating, invoicing, and requesting payments</b>. We’re one of trade contractors most cherished apps, with other 100,000 reviews on the iOS and Android app stores.</p>
					<div class="image_wrapper">
						<div class="image header_image"></div>
						<div class="caption">Our app allows contractors to quickly make estimates and invoices</div>
					</div>
					<p>We know that running a small trade business is hard - in addition to the actual trade work, our contractors have to source jobs, manage teams, handle finances, just to name a few. Joist’s mission has always been “make contractors heros,” where we take care of the paperwork so that our contractors can do what they love and focus on their craft.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Reasons for Redesign</h2>
					<p>I joined Joist about 9 months ago, around the time the team started to experiment with different revenue models instead of being a freemium app.</p>
					<p>The more I worked more on the app, the more urgently I believed that we needed a design refresh:</p>
					<h3>1) Inconsistency</h3>
					<p>The Joist experience on different platforms is very inconsistent. Joist iOS looks completely different from Joist Android and Web. They could actually be two completely different products or brands. That means for our contractors, logging into different platforms for the first time can be very jarring. This also means <b>our contractors have to learn a new set of design language</b> - different visual cues for how sections are broken off, how actions are conveyed, how icons are represented. Definitely not the effortless experience that the design team has been advocating.</p>
					<div class="image_wrapper">
						<div class="image inconsistency"></div>
						<div class="caption">The stark differences between our iOS and web and android apps</div>
					</div>
					<h3>2) Not premium experience</h3>
					<p>As Joist is exploring different revenue models, design could be a differentiator. I’d argue that the app’s current look and feel do not engender the level of trust and confidence that users would expect, especially when money’s involved. It’s true that our free app is beloved, but <b>how can we make the step over to becoming premium?</b> Perhaps if the app feels like work and time and quality has been spent perfecting a tool that’s meant for trade contractors, that bridge would be easier to cross.</p>
					<h3>3) Inefficiency</h3>
					<p>When designs look so drastically different from iOS to Android, designing one doesn’t easily translate to designing for the other. Also, the lack of defined design language both within and cross platforms slows down the team and causes confusion, which ultimately means valuable time is lost, on both the design and the engineering teams. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 class="section_title">Perfect Opportunity</h2>
					<p>The design team had been talking about a redesign for a while, but it rarely ever made it into sprints...if ever. Similarly, the engineers had been advocating for code refactor, and over time we started seeing code refactors getting sprinkled in here and there. I think more importantly, code quality became part of the normal conversation, whereas whispers of design quality could barely be heard. I had one-off conversations with engineers who were worried about the experience, but I’m not sure the rest of the team is even aware of the design debt within our app. <b>Somehow the communication within the design team was getting lost within the greater team.</b> </p>
					<p>Then as 2017 was winding down, there were a few days when my workload was relatively light. This was the perfect time to redesign. I researched, read, reflected on how to best approach not only the redesign itself, but also <b>how to get buy in from the rest of the team and especially the PMs and head of product.</b> </p>
					<p>I knew finding quantifiable data to support a redesign would be difficult, but I figured if others could experience what a possible future feels like, then it’d at least incept the idea within the team and perhaps excitement would usher a redesign quicker. Ultimately, <b>I decided that the best approach is to prototype a redesigned Joist, giving others a more concrete vision to latch onto.</b></p>

					<h2>Guiding Principles</h2>
					<h3>1) Effortless</h3>
					<p><b>Design should feel effortless.</b> Our current designs feel heavy, utilitarian, very much a tool that you’d throw into your toolbox. But what if the app feels like a breath of fresh air, a pause from the hustle of running a business? What if when you look at the app, you feel calmer and doing paperwork actually feels that much more effortless. That’d be a worthwhile experience to create.</p>
					<h3>2) Affordances</h3> 
					<p><b>Design needs to be simple and straightforward.</b> Design needs to have affordances, as our user base is older folks (30s to even 50s) and not as fluent in technology.</p>
					<h3>3) Simple</h3> 
					<p><b>Preserve our simplicity.</b> Generally speaking, our app has good information architecture and good UX, all of which we want to preserve. There are some smaller nuanced interactions that can be improved, but lots of room for growth for the visuals. This is where I saw our app growing from basic to premium. </p>
				</section>

					<h2 class="section_title">The Redesign</h2>
					<p>I started the redesign with a quick audit of our app. When over ~75% of the app is composed of the same cell or a variant of it, it was pretty easy to to decide what to focus my energy on.</p>
					<div class="image_wrapper">
						<div class="image pervasive_cell"></div>
						<div class="caption">The apple of my eye</div>
					</div>
					<p>I spent a considerable amount of time perfecting this cell since all its derivatives. It needed to be consistent across and yet flexible for all of its use cases. When a page has a list of these cells, it needed to afford easy scanning and not be overwhelming.</p>
					<div class="image_wrapper">
						<div class="image redesigned_cell"></div>
						<div class="caption">The cell’s pervasiveness</div>
					</div>
					<p>As I iterated, I experimented with different font sizes, colors and spacing. I created my own style sheet to keep all designs consistent.</p>
					<div class="image_wrapper">
						<div class="image style_guide"></div>
						<div class="caption">I studied AirBnb’s redesign diligently, including their stylesheet.</div>
					</div>
					<div class="image_wrapper">
						<div class="image cell_components"></div>
						<div class="caption">Cell components</div>
					</div>
					<p>With the foundational blocks built, it was extremely easy to mock up the main parts of the major screens.</p>
					<div class="image_wrapper">
						<div class="image redesign"></div>
						<div class="caption">Main screens redesigned</div>
					</div>
					<div class="image_wrapper">
						<div class="image per_doc_final"></div>
						<div class="caption">Video to come!</div>
					</div>
					<p>This is just a prototype and by no means the final design. I’m hoping that this prototype, juxtaposed to our current app, will raise awareness for the design debt that we have. A prototype is much more concrete and hopefully more effective of a springboard to initiate conversations about the type of experience we ultimately want to create for our contractors.</p>
					<p>I don’t expect for a redesign to happen this quarter, but as long as there’s awareness, shared language, and healthy conversations about how we’ll create an experience that’ll “make contractors heros,” over time I believe that momentum will build and be even more ready to create a better experience for our contractors. </p>
