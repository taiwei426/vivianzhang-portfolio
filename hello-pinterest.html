						<h1>Hello Pinterest!</h1>
						<p>I'm Vivian, a product designer who's a huge Pinterest fan and wants to be part of your design team!</p>
						<p>I love the product itself - I definitely spend more hours than I’d like to admit on Pinterest and it has quite literally revolutionized the way I save pictures, learn, be inspired, shop online, and even do my design work. <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/taiwei426/" target="_blank">Here are my boards</a>, and you can see that I have large collections of mood boards and design research, even more extensive interior design boards, and boards dedicated to things I want to buy. </p>
						<p>The app itself is amazingly designed, both visually and interaction wise: the incredibly easy checkout process when buying products, the hold interaction to save on mobile, and the superior image recognition technology to help find similar images.</p>
						<p>And I definitely believe the well-designedness of the app is a reflection of the product team, its process, and the collaboration across other teams - and these have all been confirmed <a href="https://designerfund.com/bridge/day-in-the-life-at-pinterest-jason-wilson/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://www.aiga.org/pinterest-founder-evan-sharp-on-how-to-manage-design-talent" target="_blank">here</a>, and <a href="https://gigaom.com/2013/03/22/how-closely-knit-design-and-engineering-teams-put-pinterest-on-a-rocket-ship/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
						<p>I can rave about Pinterest for days, but let me tell you what I can do for Pinterest. </p>

						<h2>Random product ideas I could help with</h2>
						<div class="number">1</div>
						<h3>Finding Buyable Products within Regular Pictures</h3>
						<p style="text-align: center">Below is an outfit I'm obsessed about - I want her whole ensemble. Now.</p>
						<div class="img outfit"></div>
						<p>The related pins showed me somewhat similar outfits. Visual search either gave me the exact same outfit or gave me similar ones. But neither provided a fast way to buy this outfit. </p>
						<div class="img search_2"></div>

						<p>Right now, to buy this outfit on Pinterest, I'd have search each of the products in the picture separately. (I actually have the image open on another tab and refer back to the image as I'm searching through buyable pins.)</p>
						<div class="img search_3"></div>
						
						<p>Wouldn't it great if there were a toggle in the related pins or visual searched pins that allowed me to switch from viewing similar pins to buyable pins so to purchase these items without having to switch from the image?</p>
						<div class="img buyable_visual_results"></div>
						<div class="number">2</div>
						<h3>Training Wheels for Shopping on Pinterest</h3>
						<p>Shopping on Pinterest is slightly different from shopping online. Shopping online can be broken into 3 distinct steps (which I studied throughout my current job):</p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>1) Browsing:</b> quickly selecting through a bunch of products that the shopper might be interested. Behaviors: quick view, opening up products into different tabs, quickly adding products into cart as a way of temporarily saving them to read up in more detail.</li>
							<li><b>2) Studying:</b> does a deeper read-up of the selected products to determine whether to buy. Behaviors: looking through more pictures and reading the descriptions and reviews. </li>
							<li><b>3) Buying:</b> The carefully studied products are actually bought.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Unfortunately, these behaviors aren't translated to Pinterest - there's no fluid mobility between steps 1 and 2: browsing through buying happened in a too linear fashion. </p>
						<p>I went through two behaviors when trying to replicate my online shopping workflow:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><p><b>A)</b> When I first started, after finding a buyable pin that I want, I'd open the picture page, add to bag, do this for several products, then go to the cart to study the products, only to discover that from the cart, I can't click back into the picture page to read the descriptions. This is the picture page I'm referring to:</p>
								<div class="img product_lightbox"></div>
							</li>
							<li><b>B)</b> Then I realized that to temporarily save products I'm interested in, I could create a board just devoted to products I want. That way, I can quickly pin as I'm browsing, then I can return to my "To Buy" board as I'm trying to study and finalize my purchasing decision.</li> 
						</ul>
						<p>It'd be interesting to know if others have feel similarily. If so, here are some potential solutions: </p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p><b>1) Create a default "To Buy" board </b>for everyone (they can delete it if they don't want it). The first few times someone tries to pin a buyable pin to their board, suggest temporarily saving to this board. They can then later decide to move these items to their cart.</p>
								<div class="img to_buy_board"></div>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p><b>2) Or add a "Add to Bag" button</b> & make items in the bag clickable to the image page.</p>
								<div class="img solution_2"></div>
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<div class="number">3</div>
						<h3></h3>
						<p>On a topic not about buyable pins, I've been really enjoying the newest update that was pushed a month or two ago. I really like the "Search" tab - it exposes me to other pinned topics so that I'm not siloed into the few topics that I already gravitate towards. As much as I like the latest push though, I, along with many of your biggest fans, also wonder why certain changes were made - why have all the notifications () been combined together? Why are the boards organized in terms of our last pins and that not the way we organized or just alphabetically? I'm sure there are reasons for these changes, but I'd also like to be part of helping bring back so</p>
						<!-- <p>On the topic of buyable pins, I do feel that these pins are missing some very important pieces of info that’d help an user make a purchasing decision: reviews! How's the fit, color, material? If an user has to click to the brand's website to read this info, then why would they buy via Pinterest?</p>
						<p>Anyways, these are some random ideas I've had while toiling many hours on the app. But no worries. there’s more where these come from and I’d love to share some more of my random ideas!</p> -->
